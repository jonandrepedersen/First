<h2>The Backstory</h2>
<p>The world over, hiring a tutor has traditionally been seen as a way to help struggling students to improve their grades. But in this modernized world tutoring is still by many regarded as an expensive and inefficient way too receive better grades. Our mission is to change this perception, we aim to stimulate teaching and learning among students. To give access to global online tutoring for students to reach out for assistance while studying at anytime, anywhere, to an affordable price is the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>We want to differ from other online tutoring platforms by encouraging student on student interactions. Our goal is not to have an expensive high-end tutoring platform, where both we as a company and tutors charge and unreasonably high price for services provided. We want to revolutionise the industry by letting a 2nd year student tutor a 1st year student, where they set their own prices. This will be accomplished with delivering unique and innovative solutions optimized for educational achievements, career enhancements and personal development. This will provide the users a chance to be successful and achieve education goals in a non-expensive, friendly and amusing way. </p>

<h2>The Team</h2>
<p>The Ademiq team currently consist of 4 individuals which all have been studying at the same university and have had the same drive towards creating the most suitable tutoring service for students. </p>
